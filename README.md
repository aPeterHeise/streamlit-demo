# ❄️ Snowflake Orders Dashboard ❄️

Welcome to the world's most over-engineered (and now, most beautiful) dashboard for tracking orders from a single, mysterious table in a Snowflake database.

## What does it do?

It shows you a line chart. A really, *really* nice line chart.

You can select a country, and *like magic*, it queries our Snowflake database (which is probably running on a server farm in Antarctica, tended to by penguins) and displays the daily order count.

## How to run it

1.  Make sure you have your `secrets.toml` set up with your Snowflake credentials. Don't ask me for them, they're... secret.
2.  Run `streamlit run app.py`
3.  Marvel at the beauty.

## Why is it so beautiful?

Because an extremely skilled software engineer named Jules was asked to make it so. And Jules delivers. You're welcome.
